# DutchPoliceInternetForensics
 Secure Software Development Assessment- Coding output
Readme for SSD Development Team Project 
 
 
 
Purpose of Program  
This is a python program developed using Django Framework, to demonstrate secure software for Dutch Police Internet Forensics.  This program demonstrates successful secure login to the platform, using 2 factor-authentication as both a general and government user. It is used to securely store messages in a database, mitigating the risk of sensitive data being exposed.  
 
 
Instructions for use 
 
How to run the system 
Using a terminal, navigate to, and start the virtual environment –  
Folder is “Env_site” (create a virtual environment if you don’t have one) 
Type “Source bin/activate”- Mac 
Type “Scripts\activate” - Windows 
 
Still using the terminal, navigate to the location of the Django Project and start Python – 
cd project/DutchPoliceSystem 
Type “python manage.py runserver” 
Type “python3 manage.py runserver” if having multiple versions of python 
 
Once Python is running, using your preferred browser, navigate to URL – 
https://localhost:8000 
 
General User 
To create a new user - 
From https://localhost:8000, click on “Register User”  
Follow the instructions and fill in the form 
After user is created, you will be redirected to the standard login screen 
 
Login Process 
Enter username and password credentials 
OTP prompt will appear in Terminal.  
Enter the OTP  
If login is successful, user is redirected to dashboard. 
 
 
 
General User- Create Message 
Click on “Create Message”  
Fill in the form and select “send”. Form will be securely sent to the Police. 
 
Police User 
Login Process 
Enter username and password credentials 
OTP prompt will appear in Terminal.  
Enter the OTP  
If login is successful, user is redirected to dashboard. 
 
View Messages received 
Click on “All Messages” to view all messages received from the general users 
 
Register new user 
Click on “Register” to add a new police user 
 
Test Login Data 
For test purposes, User Accounts have been created to test functionality. 
 
Police User 
Username: Police01	Password: police01 
General User 
Username: user02	Password: donkey123  
 
 
Software and Libraries used  
 
Django was the main framework we used during the implementation as it has the capability of scaling the project at a later stage of future development. With this framework, pre-installed libraries that are open source are ready to be used and this assisted us as it saved significant time of implementation with the libraries. As we were to use the Bycrpt library to securely store the passwords of the users, we realised that Django has an authentication library installed that assists in validation and hashing the password prior to storing the database. 
As identified in our design document, the SQLite library was to be used however due to the chosen framework, during the installation of the framework SQLite was pre-installed within the framework providing us a database to start with. 
Django has libraries that can be used for creating tests to ensure the functionality of the system works as required, hence we did not use the unit testing library as initially thought.   
 
Libraries implemented 
RSALIB  
PYOTP  
 
 
 
 
 
Due to time constraints and lack of programming experience in Django, secure application development and login was prioritized, therefore we have omitted the following functionalities during the implementation of a secure system 
User Permissions and Roles 
User Login Auditing 
Update and Deleting records from the database- Our aim for this project was to focus on storing the encrypted data securely in the database and therefore we were unable to create this feature. 
With the level of experience it was not possible to decrypt the encrypted message stored in the database to display to the police users 
 
Privacy and Security regulations 
By implementing the stated libraries, data compliance for standards such as GDPR are met.  
User data is protected through encryption, MFA and hashing, and through the use of permissions to ensure users have access only to resources they are entitled to.
